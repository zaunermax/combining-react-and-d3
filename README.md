## Description

Welcome to my master thesis' project of combining react and d3

### Instructions

In order to start this project you will need a fairly recent version of node.js which can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

First you need to install the project:

```bash
npm i
```

In order for the project to start correctly, create a `.env` file in the root of your project which should contain the following code:

```dotenv
NODE_PATH = src
```

Make sure you saved the `.env` file before executing any other commands.

Finally you can proceed and run the storybook suite via the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Now you can look at the components in `localhost:6006`.

Note, that the storybook is running in development mode, the components therefore are slower. I will provide a link to
a website that hosts the components in the future.
