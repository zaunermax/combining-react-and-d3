## Description

Welcome to my master thesis' project of combining react and d3

### Instructions

In order to start this project you will need a fairly recent version of node.js which can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

First you need to install the project:

```bash
npm ci
```

You can proceed and run the storybook suite via the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Now you can look at the components in `localhost:6006`.

The benchmark application can be started via the command: 

```bash
npm run start
```

After the initial start-up phase, the application is available in `localhost:3000`

Note, that the storybook is running in development mode, the components' performance is therefore a lot worse.

The two applications are hosted online: 

Benchmark application: https://reactd3bench.zaunermax.at

Component Storybook: https://reactd3storybook.zaunermax.at
